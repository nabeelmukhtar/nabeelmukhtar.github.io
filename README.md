A model is a mathematical representation of the essential elements of the Data Warehouse system's architecture, physical and virtual configuration, parallel processing and other characteristics that impact performance: Things such as processor speed, network latency, memory capacity, I/O speeds as well as software limitations such as job concurrency, degree of parallelism and workload priority. BEZNext utilizes a queuing network model approach that represents the IT infrastructure as a network of queues and servers. It then employs analytics to answer what–if questions to evaluate and compare the options and alternatives for capacity management.
